# Analysis_NoShow_Appts_Brazil
This repository contains my submission from a Udacity project analyzing a data set containing information about
no show appointments in Brazil.


The csv file required to run the jupyter notebook has also been added into this project directory.
Installation of python 3 is required with the following additional libraries:

- csv
- datetime
- pandas

Work was performed in a jupyter notebook. The link to download the jupyter notebook application can
be found here:

http://jupyter.org/install

To view the project and run the code, open the jupyter notebook file. Alternatively, to view
the summary of the project, open the html file.
